      -- A floating point number
      -- Another string

    Then prints, in this order, on a SINGLE line,
    separated by spaces:
      -- The SECOND of the two strings
      -- The cosine of the floating point number
      -- The FIRST of the two strings
      -- The FIRST of the two strings AGAIN

    No input validation is required.  Nothing else should be printed.

    Here is a sample run, where the user input is to the right
    of the colons:
        Enter a string: I went skiing!
        Enter a floating point number: 3.0
        Enter another string: Mickey Mouse
