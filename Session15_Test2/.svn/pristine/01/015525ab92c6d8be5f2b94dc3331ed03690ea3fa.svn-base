    MUTATES the first of the two given lists so that it becomes
    the item-by-item   sum   of the two given lists.

    For example, if the given lists are:
        [4, 66, 9, -2, 55, 0]
        [7, 22, 5, 10, -5, 9]
    then the first of those two lists should mutate into:
        [11, 88, 14, 8, 50, 9]

    As another example, if the given lists are:
        [ 20, -20,  10]
        [-20,  20, -10]
    then the first of those two lists should mutate into:
        [  0,   0,   0]

    Does NOT return anything explicitly (so returns  None  implicitly).
    Does NOT mutate the second list.

    Preconditions:
      :type list1: list
      :type list2: list
    and the given lists contain only numbers,
    and the lengths of two lists are the same.
